"""
The original code for the following program was written by Sangam Kumar Jain and can be found in the file test.py in this git project
You can connect with him at: http://www.facebook.com/jain.sangam

The code was written as a part of solving Project Euler Problem 3 (http://projecteuler.net/problem=3) which deals with finding the largest prime factor of a large number.

Currently the code finds all the powers of all prime factors of any large number.

I have rewritten a more modular and optimized version of the above code and tried to make it more easily comprehendable.
